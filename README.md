Hi! My name is Mitul üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Excuse the mess, I honestly wasn't expecting you. Welcome to the code that controls my evergrowing space on the internet. 

Building out my personal website has brought me a lot of joy over the years, and it's transformed many, many times. I actually try to update it every few weeks. 

If you have any questions, suggestions, think it's the ~~worst~~ best website ever? ‚Äì feel free to [tweet me](https://twitter.com/typicalmitul) üëã

##### Built with
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

### Getting Started
_Note: I do have an .env.example file, but it could take awhile to get those keys. You could delete all the code related to those endpoints if it makes things easier._

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mitul-s/$ crywolf.me.git
$ cd crywolf.me
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
# or yarn if you prefer that
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
