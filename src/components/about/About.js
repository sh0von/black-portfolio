        Throughout my professional life, I had the pleasure of joining Soapbox,
        a B2B SaaS, where I helped convert users from free to paid through
        growth experiments. While in school, I had several internships
        specifically including product roles in banking and operations at Uber.

        In my free time, Iâ€™m usually editing or taking photos, binge-watching
        vlogs by Casey Neistat, playing video games, starting a side project
        (with hopes to not abandon it), or learning about investment psychology.
